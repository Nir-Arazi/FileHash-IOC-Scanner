During DFIR investigations, validating whether known tools or malware binaries exist on a system can be time consuming, especially when dealing with large file systems or multiple potential locations.

This video demonstrates a hash based IOC sweep tool I built to quickly scan a system against a predefined hash database and return confirmed matches with full file paths.

The goal is fast, reliable triage of known indicators, allowing analysts to quickly confirm presence, reduce manual searching, and focus investigative time on analysis and response rather than file discovery.
