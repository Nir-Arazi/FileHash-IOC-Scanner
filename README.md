🔍 Hash-Based IOC Scanner (DFIR Utility)

During DFIR investigations, validating whether known tools or malware binaries exist on a system can be time-consuming—especially across large file systems or multiple potential locations.

This tool performs a hash-based IOC sweep, scanning a target system against a predefined hash database and returning confirmed matches with full file paths.

⚡ Why it exists

The goal is fast, reliable triage:

Quickly confirm the presence of known indicators

Eliminate manual file hunting

Reduce investigation time

Let analysts focus on analysis, containment, and response instead of file discovery

Designed for real-world DFIR workflows, where speed and accuracy matter.
